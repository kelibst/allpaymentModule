# allpaymentModule

A combined payment module for Paypal, Stripe and Momo

Payment module specifications

The idea is to make a NodeJs payment module that reduces the complexity of integrating various payment methods such as MTN Momo, Stripe, and Paypal into a Node and a ReactJs application.

We will first start with one payment, preferably Paypal.

Work plan
Get familiar with building Node packages
Successfully initiate account balance check process through Paypal Node API
Simplify the process
Follow the same process for other account-related tasks.
Complete the same process for the other payment method.

Identified problems:
Paypal and Stripe require an active account to be able to use the platform. I currently do not have an account with either Paypal or Stripe. Since you do have one, I believe we can use that.
